After github account is created ti generate ssh key we need this command to run on github - ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
git clone <https:URL>  / git remote add origin "<repository address > "
git pull - to pull records from repository  / git pull origin master 
git push - to push the records to repository 
---after you create / modify any file  - git status 
git add filename - to add the file to the index/ local repository 
git add -A - to add multiple files to the index/ local repository 
git commit -m "messsage "  - to save the object / version of project to the file and save to local repository . message says who is the user who has committed the change 
git commit -a "message  " to save all the files in the folder with this command 
if you see any error during git commit, use this command - git config --global user.email "email id " 
git log   - it shows all the logs which have been done in the local repository 


-------------------------------------------

new branch creation 

git branch <branch name>  - to create a new branch
git checkout <branch name> - to navigate t0 new branch 
do modification in the new branch and the git add and git commit
to bring all the modified files to master to we need to checkout to master - git checkout master and then use command git merge <branch name > so that all the files from branch will be copied to master 
note - if we need to bring files from branch to master we need to be in master directory 

git commit -a -m "message" - to commit all the files modified in the branch with out adding the files

-------------------------------------------------

git fetch commands
 git fetch ( to fecth the new file from central repository )
 git branch -a   ( to see all the branches in the local repository ) 
 git merge origin/master  ( all the new files in central repository will be merged to local repository ) 
 
 
 rebase command  - to get much cleaner history 
 
 git checkout <branch > 
 create new file and modify it 
 git add <file name> or git add -A ( to add all files ) 
 git commit -m "message" 
 git checkout master < we need to naviagte to destination directory to rebase all the files from branch ) 
 git rebase <branch name > it gets all the files from branch to master in a linear way 
 
 
 generate public ssh key 
 
 ssh-keygen  ( publich key will be generated in a path 
 cat path and take the ssh key and save in key in github 
 
 after adding the ssh-key in the git hub give the below command to sync with git bash 
 
 git -T git@github.com
 
 
 to see the new branches which are created in local repository in  the central repository 
 
 Naviagate to the new branch created in local repository 
 git checkout <branchname>
 git push origin <branch name> all the files in branch repository to the central 
 
 
 // delete branch locally
git branch -d localBranchName
 
 // delete branch remotely
git push origin --delete remoteBranchName
 
 
 revert functionality 
 
 git add filename 
 modify the file with some code 
 git commit -m "message" 
 modify the file again with new lines of code 
  git commit -m "message" 
  
  git log 
  take the first 8 digits of commit code and use below command 
   git checkout hexadecimalcode filename  -- it will bring back the file to the first version of the code 
   cat filename and check the code
